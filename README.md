This project explores a dataset containing details on over 426,000 used cars with the goal of identifying factors that significantly impact car prices. 

Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, this analysis aims to equip used car dealerships with data-driven insights to optimize their inventories based on consumer preferences and market trends.

## Project Results
Our analysis revealed several key factors that influence used car prices:

* Newer vehicles tend to have higher prices.
* Lower mileage correlates with higher pricing.
* Some brands and models are more favorable in retaining value.
* Cars in better condition command higher prices.

## Visualizations
To support our findings, we have included a series of visualizations that illustrate the key factors affecting used car prices:

1. **Boxplot - Car Manufacturer vs. Price**:

This boxplot indicates the variance in prices across different car manufacturers, highlighting the brands that command higher prices in the used car market.

2. **Heatmap - Feature Correlation with Price**:

The heatmap shows how different features correlate with the price of used cars, guiding dealers on what features contribute most to a car’s value.

3. **Scatter Plot - Price vs. Year**:

A scatter plot that showcases the relationship between the car’s price and its year, clearly showing that newer cars tend to fetch higher prices.

## Key Recommendations
* Prioritize newer, low-mileage cars in inventory.
* Adjust stock levels based on brand and model insights.
* Implement a dynamic pricing model based on our findings.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the used car market, assisting dealers in making informed decisions to optimize their inventory and improve profitability. The analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in a competitive market.
