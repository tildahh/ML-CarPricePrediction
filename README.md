# ML-CarPricePrediction
This project explores a dataset containing details on over 426,000 used cars with the goal of identifying factors that significantly impact car prices. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to predict car prices based on key features such as mileage, year, and brand.

## CRISP-DM Framework 
Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, this analysis aims to equip used car dealerships with data-driven insights to optimize their inventories based on consumer preferences and market trends.

## Project Results
The goal was to identify factors that affect the price of used cars to help a used car dealership optimize inventory.

Our analysis revealed several key factors that influence used car prices:

* Newer vehicles tend to have higher prices.
* Lower mileage correlates with higher pricing.
* Some brands and models are more favorable in retaining value.
* Cars in better condition command higher prices.

## Visualizations
To support our findings, we have included a series of visualizations that illustrate the key factors affecting used car prices:
1. **Number of Cars by Make in dataset**:

2.  **Boxplot - Car Manufacturer vs. Price**:

This boxplot indicates the variance in prices across different car manufacturers, highlighting the brands that command higher prices in the used car market. Ferrari, Aston Martin and Tesla are the most expesive brands.

3. **Heatmap - Feature Correlation with Price**:

The heatmap shows how different features correlate with the price of used cars, guiding dealers on what features contribute most to a car’s value.

4. **Price vs Condition**:

5. **Scatter Plot - Price vs. Year**:
![Price vs. Year](https://github.com/tildahh/ML-CarPricePrediction/blob/main/images/3.png)
A scatter plot that showcases the relationship between the car’s price and its year, clearly showing that newer cars tend to fetch higher prices.

## Key Recommendations
* Prioritize newer, low-mileage cars in inventory.
* Adjust stock levels based on brand and model insights.
* Implement a dynamic pricing model based on our findings.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the used car market, assisting dealers in making informed decisions to optimize their inventory and improve profitability. The analysis demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in a competitive market.
